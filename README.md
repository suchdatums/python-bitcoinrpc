# NOTICE:

I could not get the [origional repository](https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc) to work... I don't know why, but it wouldn't import when installed in a local virtual environment.  In order to save time and continue development, I have forked the project and trimmed it down so that I may use the code for my projects.
